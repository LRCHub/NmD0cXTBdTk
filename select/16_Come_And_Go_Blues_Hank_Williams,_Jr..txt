People say that you're no good
But I wouldn't cut you loose, baby, if I could
I seem to stay down on the ground
Baby, I'm too far gone to turn around

Oh, if only you would make up your mind
Take me where you go, you're leaving me [Incomprehensible] behind

Woman, you got those come and go blues
Yes, you do
Lord, you got those come and go blues
Yes, you do
And oh, you got me feelin' like a fool
Just like a fool

'Round and 'round, 'round we go
Don't ask me why I stay here, I don't know
Well, maybe I'm a fool to care
Without your sweet love, baby, I would be nowhere

So here I'll stay, locked in your web
Till that day I might find someone else
But I don't know just when that would be
But I don't know, I can't say 'cause I can't see

Sail on, my darlin', sail on
You just go your way and I'll go mine
But it seems to me that I once heard
That everything is finally cured by time

Yes, sail on, my darlin', sail on
And I'll just wish you good luck
And I'll see you when you come next time

Lord, you got those come and go blues
Yes, you do
Woman, you got those come and go blues
I swear you do
Oh and you got me feelin' like a fool
Just like a fool
