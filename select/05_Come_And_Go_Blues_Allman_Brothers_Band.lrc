[00:12.62] People say that you're no good,
[00:17.31] But i wouldn't cut you loose, baby, if i could.
[00:22.72] Well, i seem to stay down on the ground,
[00:28.29] Baby, i'm too far gone to turn around.
[00:33.77] Oh, if only you would make up your mind,
[00:38.85] Take me where you go, you're leaving me behind.
[00:44.94] Lord, you got those come and go blues,
[00:55.41] Lord, you got those some and go blues,
[01:03.25] Yes, you do, oh and you got me feelin' like a fool.
[01:28.75] 
[01:53.80] 'Round 'n' 'round, 'round we go, -
[01:58.78] Don't ask me why i stay here, i don't know.
[02:04.16] Well maybe i'm a fool to care,
[02:09.88] Without your sweet love, baby i would be nowhere.
[02:15.44] Here i'll stay, locked in your web,
[02:20.58] Till that day i might find somebody else.
[02:27.52] I don't know just when that would be,
[02:38.05] I don't know, i can't say as i can't see.
[03:40.46] Lord you got me feeling like a fool.
[03:58.46] 
[03:41.81] Sail on, darlin', sail on
[03:43.05] Woman, you go your way, and i'll go mine
[03:43.35] Seems to me, that i once heard
[03:44.03] That everything is finally cured by time
[03:44.28] So sail on, darlin', sail on
[03:45.14] Lord, i wish you good luck
[03:49.79] And i'll see you when you come next time.
[04:10.29] 
[03:50.72] Woman, you got those come and go blues
[03:51.44] Yeah, you got those come and go blues,
[03:52.08] Yes, you do, oh and you got me feelin' like a fool.
