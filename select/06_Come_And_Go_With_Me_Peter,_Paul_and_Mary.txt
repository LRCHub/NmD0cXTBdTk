There ain't no kneelin' in that land
There ain't no kneelin' in that land

Oh, they'll be singin' in that land
A-voices ringin' in that land
Oh, they'll be freedom in that land
Where I'm bound

Oh, they'll be singin' in that land
They'll be singin' in that land
Freedom in that land where I'm bound

Well, I'm gonna walk the streets of glory on that
A great day in the mornin'

Great Day in the Mornin'

I'm gonna walk the streets of glory
I'm gonna put on the shoes that's holy
I'm gonna walk the streets of glory, hallelu

Don't you wanna hear the children singin' on that
Great day in the mornin'?
Don't you wanna hear the children singin' on that
Great day in the mornin'?

Don't you wanna hear all the children singin'?
Big ol' bells a-ringin'
Don't you wanna hear all the children singin'? Hallelu

Don't you wanna stand in the line together on that
Great day in the mornin'?
Don't you wanna stand in the line together on that
Great day in the mornin'?

Don't you wanna stand in the line together?
Shake hands with one another
Don't you wanna stand in the line together? Hallelu

Come and go with me to that land
Come and go with me to that land
Come and go with me to that land

Come and go with me to that land
Come and go with me to that land
With me to that land where I'm bound
With me to that land where I'm bound
