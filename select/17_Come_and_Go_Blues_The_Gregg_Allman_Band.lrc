[00:12.70] People say that you're no good
[00:18.12] But I wouldn't cut you loose, baby, if I could
[00:23.52] I seem to stay down on the ground
[00:29.05] Baby, I'm too far gone to turn around
[00:47.55] 
[00:34.42] Oh, if only you would make up your mind
[00:40.86] Take me where you go, you're leaving me [Incomprehensible] behind
[01:13.36] 
[00:44.40] Woman, you got those come and go blues
[00:54.49] Yes, you do
[00:57.15] Lord, you got those come and go blues
[01:05.38] Yes, you do
[01:12.69] And oh, you got me feelin' like a fool
[01:27.15] Just like a fool
[01:35.15] 
[01:38.94] 'Round and 'round, 'round we go
[01:44.34] Don't ask me why I stay here, I don't know
[01:49.84] Well, maybe I'm a fool to care
[01:55.24] Without your sweet love, baby, I would be nowhere
[02:19.74] 
[02:01.68] So here I'll stay, locked in your web
[02:06.14] Till that day I might find someone else
[02:14.31] But I don't know just when that would be
[02:24.37] But I don't know, I can't say 'cause I can't see
[02:48.37] 
[03:23.32] Sail on, my darlin', sail on
[03:28.82] You just go your way and I'll go mine
[03:34.24] But it seems to me that I once heard
[03:39.76] That everything is finally cured by time
[03:59.76] 
[03:45.17] Yes, sail on, my darlin', sail on
[03:50.69] And I'll just wish you good luck
[03:53.38] And I'll see you when you come next time
[04:13.38] 
[03:56.92] Lord, you got those come and go blues
[04:03.32] Yes, you do
[04:07.88] Woman, you got those come and go blues
[04:14.18] I swear you do
[04:21.40] Oh and you got me feelin' like a fool
[04:30.50] Just like a fool
