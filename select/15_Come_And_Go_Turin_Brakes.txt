My open heart is all a flutter
Memories as sweet as butter
Running down the blade of a double edged sword

I recall a kiss, a photograph
And in this I can't recall the faces of you all

'Cause you come and you go
'Cause you come and you go
'Cause you come and you go, oh

Open up my heart, you open up my heart
And let some sunlight down the avenue
I'm going to take my time today
I'm going to take what's mine today

'Cause you come and you go
'Cause you come and you go
'Cause you come and you go, oh

I'm going to take my time today
I'm going to take what's mine today

'Cause you come and you go
'Cause you come and you go
'Cause you come and you go, oh
