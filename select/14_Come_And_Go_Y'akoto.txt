And if my face fades
I'll come back and let you touch it again
And if you forget my name
I'll come and introduce myself again
Cuz I love the worst of you
So what is left for me to do
I'll never be too proud
Now love came into my house

Come go leave and return
Be sure you find me there

And if you find no peace
My love will carry you over seas
And if you still can't believe
I'll let you have all of me
I love the worst of you
So what is left for me to do

I'll never be too wise
Let my heart judge what happens now

Come go leave and return
Be sure you find me there

Who said who said it will be easy?
Who said who said that I wouldn't fight for you?
I will fight for you

Come go leave and return
Be sure you find me there

Come go leave and return
Be sure you find me there

Come go leave and return
Be sure you find me there
