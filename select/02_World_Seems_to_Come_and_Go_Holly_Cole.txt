World seems to come and go
When you're driving in your car
The world seems to come and go
It don't matter where you are
World seems to come and go
I passed the same car an hour ago
Looks just like the car
Of a boy that I used to know, yeah
I wonder is he listening
Can he hear these words that I'm thinking?
And sometimes when it's late at night
Does he remember?
World seems to come and go
When you're driving in your car
The world seems to come and go
It don't matter who you are
Looks like today is another day
But I can't say that I can say
Cause there ain't a single thing that I know
Except how the world it comes and it goes
A hundred miles ago, up above
I saw a thunderhead shaped like a dove
But now the storm has torn it apart
Like a boy who found an open window
Flew out of my broken heart
World seems to come and go
When I'm driving in my car
World seems to come and go
It don't matter where you are
And now I passed another town
I close my eyes before I look around
And I listen for that old familiar sound, yeah
World seems to come and go
When I'm driving in my car
The world seems to come and go
It don't matter where you are
The world seems to come and go
When you're driving in your car
The world seems to come and go
It don't matter who you are
So, so, so
It don't matter who you are
So, so, so
