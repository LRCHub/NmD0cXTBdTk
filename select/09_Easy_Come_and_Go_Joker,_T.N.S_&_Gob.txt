Easy come
Easy Go

Seems to me
You want me to see
That you love me
But baby It already shows

No need for tears
No need for crying
All through these years
Of troubles and fears

Never once I thought
We'd start all over again

And baby
Hold me one last time
Cause baby
I am letting you go this time

Easy come and go
Little should you know
Life ain't full of dreams

We're falling at the scenes
Hoping you would see
It's not meant for me
This can no longer last
Easy come, easy go

Feel it come
Feel it go
Always on the edge
When something is wrong
Can't u see you and I
We were slipping away from the start

Yeah
And baby, hold me one last time... No no no
Cause baby,
I am letting you go this time
