Some people down on the road
And others rather stay at home
Some just go down gambling
And then it go
I give it all the way for a pedal goal
But the land of promises I saw
Picking up the pieces and then it gone

You don't live me alive to give
The time we waste while we live
Are you coming by or going home
Ask and knock down on my floor
Your and will dream come and go
Up on the mountain I'm gonna breath
And maybe see what I can see
But your all around me, and then it go

You don't live me alive to give
The time we waste while we live
Are you coming by or going home
Ask and knock down on my floor
In end these dreams they come and go
They come and go

You don't leave me alive to give
The time we waste while we live
Are you coming by or going home
Ask and knock down on my floor
In end these dreams they come and go
They come and go
